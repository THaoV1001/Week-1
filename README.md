## Business Activities

Unlike traditional investment platform, where investments are pooled and managed by the trustee, Stockspot provides a Managed Discretionary Account (MDA) service. The service allows investors to have direct control and full ownership of their investments which are registered under their name and managed by the Investment Program selected. As outlined by Stockspot, clients’ funds will be automatically invested and optimised with algorithms using a mixed of low-cost share, bond and gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). 

According to [Canstar][Canstar], the cost of seeing a traditional financial advisor starting from $2,500 to $3,500 to set up a financial plan and an additional $3,000 to $3,500 for annual ongoing engagement. In addition to this, advisors can charge an annual asset-based fees of up to 1% for management of clients’ asset. Stockspot however, prides itself on a low and transparent fee structure where it does not charge any initial or ongoing advice fee. Instead, has a tiering asset-based fee structure that starts from 0.05% plus GST per month for account balance starting from $10,000 and decreases to the minimum of 0.03% plus GST per month when the account balance reaches above $2,000,000.

## Landscape

As showed by [Australian Fintech][Australian_Fintech], in addition to Stockspot, there are approximately 21 other wealth management firms that utilise robo-advisors and automatic investment solutions. [Statista][Statista] also highlighted that asset under management for firms that utilising robo-advice in Australia is expected to grow at 38.63% per annum to US $21,222M by 2025 and the numbers of investors are expected to reach more than 1M. The main advantage of robo-advice come from the fact that many investors do not want or cannot afford ongoing monitoring of their investments. Automated investment and robo-advice services provide attractive returns with low capital requirement unlike traditional investment services offered by the banks or human financial advisors.

During an interview with ASX Monthly Ideas Exchange, Sarah King – head of client care of Stockspot, mentioned that the firm utilises mainly passive long-term investing with buy and hold with an emphasis in tactical asset allocation through Modern Portfolio Theory. Through automatic rebalancing and algorithmic trading, Stockspot was able to outperform similar diversified funds over the five years period and especially during the Covid crash.

## Recommendations

Currently, Stockspot only provides investment management services. To further expand Stockspot business and revenue, the firm could provide cashflows and personal budget planning service. This service could be added as an additional step during engagement process. Currently, the engagement process comprises of the following steps: 

- **Step 1**: Create Your Account
- **Step 2**: Receive a custom investment strategy 
- **Step 3**: Complete the sign-up process 
- **Step 4**: Open Your Account and start investing 
- **Step 5**: Log in to the investment dashboard
- **Step 6**: Top up regularly

By adding cashflows and personal budget planning service to Step 2, this will potentially increase fund flow to Stockspot as clients will be likely to budget their spending and have more cash available for investment. Robo-advice can also be utilised for this additional service using clients information gathered in Step 1.
